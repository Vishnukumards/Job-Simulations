# BCG Data Science Job Simulation (Forage) – September 2024

This repository documents my experience completing the **Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Data Science Job Simulation** offered by **Forage**. As an aspiring data scientist, I undertook this simulation to apply my analytical, modeling, and communication skills in a real-world business scenario: predicting customer churn for a hypothetical client.

## 🔍 Project Overview

In this simulation, I was tasked with assisting a consulting team by performing a **customer churn analysis** for a fictional client, XYZ Analytics. The core objective was to identify customers likely to leave the service and develop a strategic approach to prevent churn through actionable insights.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

### 🔸 Ambiguity in Business Requirements
**Problem:** Initially, it was unclear what specific metrics mattered most to the client (e.g., churn rate vs. lifetime value).
**Solution:** I framed multiple hypotheses based on churn scenarios and refined them through exploratory analysis. I aligned model output to business objectives in the final report.

### 🔸 Feature Relevance and Noise
**Problem:** The dataset contained several features with little to no impact on churn prediction.
**Solution:** I performed feature importance analysis using Random Forest’s `feature_importances_` and eliminated low-impact features to improve model generalization.

### 🔸 Balancing Accuracy and Interpretability
**Problem:** High-performance models (e.g., ensemble methods) often sacrificed interpretability.
**Solution:** I selected Random Forest to strike a balance and used SHAP values to explain predictions.
