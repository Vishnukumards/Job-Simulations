What I learned in this job simulation is the first thing I worked on the data set called Daikibo Telemetry There's some of the machines are not working properly in some of the factories so what I did is using the data set I Analyized the downtime of Machines and where particularly the machines are downtime more. I use a tableau and uploaded that Jason Pearl in Tableau and draw Most downtime machine using dashboards. This was my first task and the second task was I need to check the equality score and I rated the machines like fair and machines are highly disaster so Based on that data they can take decisions



“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in Deloitte's job simulation on the Forage platform, and
it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to be part of the
team at Deloitte.
I was able to analyse data and create a dashboard. I practised using Tableau and
Excel and built my data analysis skills in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on technology problems
for clients and I'm excited to apply these skills on a team at a company like
Deloitte.
